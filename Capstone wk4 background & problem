Project: The suitble location for new branch of After You Desert Cafe

After You is very famous Desert Cafe in Thailand. You can follow via https://www.afteryoudessertcafe.com/en/. Now, there are 74 branches in Thailand which is fantastic amount of branch.  All branches are going well from first start until now and then After You are listed in stock exchange in Thailand. They try to open new branch with now is not easy to find out the place since they are saturation of new branch. In addition, there is some lesson learn in 2017 that they tried to open new branch in the airport however it is not work and have to be closed in 2018 to stop loss of investment.

In this case, it would be better if data science can be differentiated type of current branch into 4-5 clusteres and provide this data to After You Company especially for CEO to understand the point of view in data science data support. With additional analysis with unofficial information e.g. same store sales grouwth or sales per month in each branch/cluster. It will help to predict the new appropriate location of new branch.
